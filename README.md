### Projet Setup
1. I initialize the project with Angular CLI, I did not want to add any other dependencies. I wanted to use the basic Angular framework to build the project.
2. I created a simple service to handle the string calculation.
3. Created tests for the same service
4. I was following the TDD approach, so I started with the simplest test and then wrote the code to pass the test. https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/tdd-assessment/
5. I added more tests to cover more scenarios.
6. Deployed the assessment on https://incubyte-assessment.vercel.app/ (Open DevTools console window to see simple output by app comp)
